Tilling window manager for wayland   
Works as demo for cl-wlc   
Works only with ecl

Currently it works but is not suitable for every day use.     
Keymaps and groups are implemented.   
For now every application is just in fullscreen.   


### Features to be implemented   
Some kind of layout system that allows for splitting screens horizontally and vertically and lets you resize them.
